Description: Designed to streamline data analysis and statistical testing, reducing the length of R 
    scripts while generating well-formatted outputs in 'pdf', 'Microsoft Word', and 'Microsoft Excel' 
    formats. In essence, the package contains functions which are sophisticated wrappers around 
    existing R functions that are called by using 'f_' (user f_riendly) prefix followed by the normal 
    function name. This first version of the 'rfriend' package focuses  primarily on data exploration, 
    including tools for creating summary tables, f_summary(), performing data transformations, 
    f_boxcox() in part based on 'MASS/boxcox' and 'rcompanion', and f_bestNormalize() 
    which wraps and extends functionality from the 'bestNormalize' package. Furthermore, 'rfriend' 
    can automatically (or on request) generate visualizations such as boxplots, f_boxplot(), 
    QQ-plots, f_qqnorm(), histograms f_hist(), and density plots. Additionally, the package includes 
    four statistical test functions: f_aov(), f_kruskal_test(), f_glm(), f_chisq_test for sequential 
    testing and visualisation of the 'stats' functions: aov(), kruskal.test(), glm() and chisq.test. 
    These functions support testing multiple response variables and predictors, while also handling 
    assumption checks, data transformations, and post hoc tests. Post hoc results are automatically 
    summarized in a table using the compact letter display (cld) format for easy interpretation. The 
    package also provides a function to do model comparison, f_model_comparison(), and several 
    utility functions to simplify common R tasks. For example, f_clear() clears the workspace and 
    restarts R with a single command; f_setwd() sets the working directory to match the directory 
    of the current script; f_theme() quickly changes 'RStudio' themes; and f_factors() converts 
    multiple columns of a data frame to factors, and much more. If you encounter any issues or have 
    feature requests, please feel free to contact me via email.
Note: When loading, both MuMIn and rstatix are imported. Since rstatix internally depends on broom, 
    this may trigger a warning about S3 method overwrites, specifically for nobs.fitdistr and 
    nobs.multinom. These warnings are harmless and do not affect functionality.
