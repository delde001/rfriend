## Overview

`rfriend` is an R package designed to streamline data analysis and statistical testing by wrapping complex or repetitive code into convenient, user-friendly functions prefixed with `f_`. Its primary focus is data exploration, statistical tests, and creating publication-ready output in multiple formats including PDF, Microsoft Word, and Excel.

The package helps you write shorter code while producing well-formatted summaries, visualizations, and statistical tests, automatically handling data transformations, assumption checking, and post hoc testing.

## Features

- **Summary Tables:** `f_summary()` generates comprehensive summary tables.
- **Data Transformations:**  
  - `f_boxcox()` for Box-Cox transformations (wrapping MASS/boxcox and rcompanion)  
  - `f_bestNormalize()` wraps and extends normalization from the `bestNormalize` package.
- **Visualizations:** Easily create:  
  - Boxplots (`f_boxplot()`)  
  - QQ-plots (`f_qqnorm()`)  
  - Histograms (`f_hist()`)  
  - Density plots
- **Statistical Tests:** Run and visualize tests on multiple variables and predictors, with automatic assumption checking and post hoc analysis:  
  - ANOVA: `f_aov()`  
  - Kruskal-Wallis: `f_kruskal_test()`  
  - Generalized Linear Models: `f_glm()`  
  - Chi-square Tests: `f_chisq_test()`
- **Model Comparison:** Compare models easily with `f_model_comparison()`.
- **Utilities:**  
  - `f_clear()` clears the workspace and restarts R.  
  - `f_setwd()` sets working directory to the current scriptâ€™s location.  
  - `f_theme()` switches RStudio themes quickly.  
  - `f_factors()` converts multiple dataframe columns to factors.

## Installation

`rfriend` requires R (>= 4.4.0) and several dependencies (see DESCRIPTION for details). You can install the latest released version from CRAN with:

```

install.packages("rfriend")

```

If you want the latest development version (if available on GitHub):

```


# install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("delde001/rfriend")

```

---

## Basic Usage

```

library(rfriend)

# Summary of your dataset

f_summary(your_dataframe)

# Run ANOVA on multiple response variables

f_aov(response_var1 +  response_var1 ~ predictor1 * predictor2, data = your_dataframe)

# Create a boxplot of a variable

data(mtcars)
f_boxplot(hp + disp ~ gear*cyl,
           data=mtcars,
           boxplot_explanation = FALSE,
           output_type = "word"
           )

# Perform Box-Cox transformation

transformed <- f_boxcox(your_dataframe$variable)

# Clear workspace and restart R

f_clear()

```

For detailed usage and examples, please refer to the package vignettes and help files.

## Known Issues

- When loading `rfriend`, you may see harmless warnings about S3 method overwrites related to `nobs.fitdistr` and `nobs.multinom` due to imported packages (`MuMIn`, `rstatix`). These do not affect the functionality.
